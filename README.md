# HELLO WORLD

This document is for practicing GIT and to learn about branching.  I am using the tutorial from https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/.

I've also used https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches to look up some terminal commands.  The guides.github link was done without terminal and having a reference for commands like git checkout -b to create a new branch seems like an important thing to have.

Happy branching!  Git Learned!
