# HELLO WORLD

This document is for practicing GIT and to learn about branching.  I am using the tutorial from https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/.

I've also used https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches to look up some terminal commands.  The above link to the tutorial was done all within a web browser, and we ain't about that life.
